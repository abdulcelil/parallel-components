# About the C++ Parallel Components Thread Container Library
With this library, communication between threads is simpler than global variables can be provided.
These components, represented by the node class, can transfer the results they produce to other components.
We can imagine these components in real life just like the units working in a factory or like humans.
These units can transfer what they produce to each other.The components consist of a simple Node class.
Node classes run the functions of the threads they are connected to and the values they produce
transfer them to the output queues they host.


# Tests

I haven't written the test codes yet, I ran it in Visual Studio 2019.
